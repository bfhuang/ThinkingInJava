Java threads are objects like any other java objects.

Threads are instances of class.java.lang.Thread, or instances of subclass of this class.

In addition to being objects, java threads can also execute code.

There are two ways to specify what code the concurrency should execute. The first is to create
a subclass of Thread and override the run() method. The second method is to pass an object
that implements Runnable to the Thread constructor.


Interface Runnable{
    void run();
}

The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instance are intended to be executed by a concurrency.

Class ThreadLocal<T> {
    ThreadLocal();

    T get();
    protected T initialValue();
    void remove();
    void set(T value);
}

Class Thread{

}
